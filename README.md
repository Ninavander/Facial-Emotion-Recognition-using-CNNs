# MSc-Final-project
### This work is my final project named 'Facial Emotion Recognition using CNNs'
## OverView
### In this work, we applied 4 mainstream/good-performance in previous research CNN architecture to FER2013 dataset. After compare the results of CNN models, we choose 3 ones with better performance to do ensemble, and got SOTA test accuracy 73.31%.
## Base Models:
###       VGGNet
###       ResNet-18
###       DenseNet-121
###       SENet-18
